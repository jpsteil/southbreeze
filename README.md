# SOUTH BREEZE ENTERPRISES

South Breeze Enterprises is built around the structure of the Microsoft Northwind database, but converted
to SQLite.

This web application serves as an example of how to use many py4web features including:
* Form and Custom Forms
* Grids
* Grid Columns
* Htmx
  * Embedded forms
  * Embedded grids
  * Autocomplete
  
For more info or questions you can find me lurking on the py4web google group or Discord channel.
